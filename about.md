# About
<!--author-->

During my studies so far I have developed an interest in three major areas. First, I am interested in the development of memory across the lifespan. Secondly, I like to learn about the methods with which we can research memory and development! And lastly, how can this research process be structured to be as open and reproducible as possible and what tools can we use for this?
