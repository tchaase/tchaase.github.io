# Welcome!
<!--author-->

During my studies, I have developed a strong interest in three major areas.
1. Firstly, I am fascinated by the development of memory across the lifespan. 
2. Secondly, I have a keen interest in the methods used to research memory and development. I enjoy learning about the different approaches and techniques that are employed in this field. 
3. Finally, I am passionate about open and reproducible research practices. I believe that research should be transparent and accessible to others in the scientific community, and I am interested in exploring the tools and resources available for achieving this goal.
