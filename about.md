# About
<!--author-->

During my studies so far I have developed an interest in three major areas:
1. Firstly, I am interested in the development of memory across the lifespan. 
2. Secondly, I like to learn about the methods with which we can research memory and development! 
3. And lastly: How can this research process be structured to be as open and reproducible as possible and what tools are available?
